# DiscordBot
This is a basic discord bot that can follow commands and play music.

`index.js` is the basic setup for the bot and allows it to connect to the commands. This bot requires `npm install discord.js` and `discord.js-commando`
and finally `npm install ytdl-core` otherwise the bot will not be able to process correctly.

#Other info
This bot isn't necessarily a big project, it has a lot of code from the Discord.js library examples + a few examples from how to setup a youtube bot from various videos.
